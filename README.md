# IntroToReactV5
Repository created for the Intro to React V5 course on https://frontendmasters.com


The project is about a pet adoption site, it uses functional components with hooks and also class components with lifecycle methods.

I created this readme file after the commits i made so just tu clarify, when i wrote "restating" i meant the "missing" files.
